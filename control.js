// Operators in  js
// An operator is symbol that performs operations in one or more operands
// 1. Arithmetiv=c operators


let a = 10;
let b = 10;

console.log(` the value of {a} + {b} is ${a + b}`); //addition operator
console.log(` the value of {a} % {b} is ${ a % b}`);//modulas operator
console.log(` the value of {a} - {b} is ${a - b}`);//subtraction operator
console.log(` the value of {a} * {b} is ${a * b}`); //multiplication operator
console.log(` the value of {a} ** {b} is ${a ** b}`);// exponential operator
console.log(` the value of {a}  is ${a++}`);//post-incremental operator
console.log(` the value of {a} ++ is ${++a}`); //pre-increment operator





// 2. Asssignemmet oparator
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z =  15;

x -=y;
console.log(x);

// Logical operators
let x3 = 10;
let y3 = 20;

console.log(x3 == y3 && x3 < y3); //AND LOGICAL OPERATOR
console.log(x3 == y3 || x3 < y3); //OR Operator
console.log(!(x3 == y3)); //logical opertor
